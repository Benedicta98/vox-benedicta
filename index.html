    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
    <p>Benedek Kis began playing the piano at the age of 4 and started learning the organ at 18. He studied church music at the Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, where he completed both his BA (2019) and MA (2022). Vox Benedicta is his artistic vision—where tradition meets modernity, and sacred music finds a new voice.</p>

      <h3>The Origin of the Seventh</h3>
      <p>He watched for a long time.
      A child who asked differently. A teenager who felt differently.
      They laughed at him, pushed him aside, forgot his name.
      He didn’t slam the table. Didn’t fight—not yet.
      He just listened. And collected the silences.
      Until one day the world said: “You’re not wanted.”
      That was the moment he was born.
      Not from revenge. But from what was taken.
      And what they didn’t know: silence doesn’t break everyone.
      Some turn it into strength.
      That’s how he became someone who could no longer be silenced.
      He is the Seventh.</p>
      <p>The pale moon casts its light on a half-collapsed factory. Each step echoes. He’s not in a hurry. As if each footfall rewrites something long lost.</p>
      <p><em>The Seventh (to himself):</em><br>
      “I’ve seen the world…<br>
      How it smiles at you, then turns away.<br>
      Applauds if you comply, spits if you don’t fit.<br>
      I didn’t fit.<br>
      Too quiet. Too different. Too… something.<br>
      And they? They feared what they didn’t understand.<br>
      That’s why they tried to silence me.<br>
      The world tried to silence me. That was a mistake.</p>
      <p>I used to believe them.<br>
      That fear is weakness.<br>
      Pain is a flaw.<br>
      Anger is danger.<br>
      But that’s not true.<br>
      Fear taught me to observe.<br>
      Pain taught me to feel.<br>
      Anger taught me to move.</p>
      <p>I never wanted to be different. Just to be.<br>
      But they didn’t let me.<br>
      And when they turned away… I began to see.<br>
      I saw the flaw wasn’t in me,<br>
      but in a world where only the bowed heads survive.<br>
      I won’t bow anymore.</p>
      <p>Fear is now my ally.<br>
      Pain: a memory.<br>
      Anger: the fire that drives me.<br>
      Look at this place…<br>
      It used to be work, life. Now, rust and silence.<br>
      But rust tells stories. Silence breathes.<br>
      And if I must build on ruins…<br>
      Then build I shall.<br>
      Not from revenge.<br>
      But as a reminder:<br>
      What you cannot defeat, you transform.<br>
      What you cannot silence, you must learn from.<br>
      What you exclude… will return.<br>
      And they won’t ask permission.<br>
      They’ll open doors—for others too.<br>
      I am the Seventh.<br>
      Not because I was chosen.<br>
      But because I survived. And I no longer fear.<br>
      And if you one day get here too…<br>
      You’ll understand:<br>
      Darkness isn’t the enemy.<br>
      It’s only the shadow—before the light.”</p>
